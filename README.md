# ibkr-portfolio-groups-and-colors
Unpacked (unpublished in the store) chrome extension for IBKR Client Portal, to organize the portfolio list using multiple colors (white, green, red, blue, yellow or orange) or 2 tabs (Growth Positions or High-Yield Dividend Positions).

How to use it (on IBKR Portfolio page):
- Click the name of a Portfolio Position to change the color.
- Double-click the name of a Portfolio Position to change the tab group.
- Click on a tab to toggle the group of visible listed positions.

P.S. If you need more colors or more than 2 tabs, code it yourself'ยก (im done here)
