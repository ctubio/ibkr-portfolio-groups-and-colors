# ibkr-portfolio-groups-and-colors
Unpacked (unpublished in the store) chrome extension for IBKR Client Portal.

Organize the portfolio list using multiple colors (white, green, red, blue, purple, yellow or orange) or 2 tabs (Growth Positions or High-Yield Dividend Positions).

How to use it (on IBKR Portfolio page):
- Click the name of a Portfolio Position to change the color.
- Double-click the name of a Portfolio Position to change the tab group.
- Click on a tab to toggle the group of visible listed positions.

Other features:
- Click on any price to enable Text-to-speech every 21 seconds (of Net Amount value or any position Last Price value).
- Click on any mini chart of the right sidebar to open a new window with a TradingView chart.
- Colorful columns to easy read the table of positions or the balances, based on FIX fields id numbers when possible.
- Colorful top Bid/Ask price with a custom opinionated volume indicator based on the current Ask/Bid sizes.
- CSS for the whole layout redesigned to allow the table of positions to make use of all useless white spaces vertically and horizontally, while moving useless menus and headers out of the way too.
- On Trades page, click on any trade to copy the "ticker + amount + average price" to the textarea (as trading notes).

P.S. If you need more colors or more than 2 tabs, code it yourself'¡
